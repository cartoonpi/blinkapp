# blinkapp
BlinkApp helps you regularly blink your eves when on web.

Many people have problem of dry eyes caused due to very high screen time. We tend to blink less frequently while on watching something on a screen. 

The way blink app works is it prompts you to blink gently at regular intervals.

You can visit sample page here : https://cartoonpi.github.io/blinkapp/
and you can find code in blinkapp.js file

The next step in the project will be to wrap this into a chrome/ firefox extension and add some basic controls
